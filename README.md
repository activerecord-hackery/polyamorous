Polyamorous is an extraction of shared code from the
[Active Record Hackery](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery) gems
[Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack),
[Squeel](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/squeel) and
[MetaSearch](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/meta_search) by
[Ernie Miller](http://twitter.com/erniemiller) and maintained by
[Ryan Bigg](http://twitter.com/ryanbigg),
[Xiang Li](http://bigxiang.github.io),
[Jon Atack](http://twitter.com/jonatack),
[Sean Carroll](https://github.com/seanfcarroll) and a great little group of
[contributors](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/polyamorous/graphs/contributors).

It is an internal library for extending various versions of Active Record with
polymorphism. There is no public API, so it's `:nodoc:`. Move along. Nothing to
see here.
